The world's light shines, shine as it will,
The world will love its darkness still.
I doubt though when the world's in hell,
It will not love its darkness half so well.

Darkness can't drive out darkness; only light can do that.
Hate can't drive out hate; only love can do that.

Deep into that darkness peering,
Long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting,
Dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.

Beauty and Harmony,
All governed by one eternal Law,
All that begins must end.

Evil is Evil,
Lesser, greater, middling; makes no difference.
The degreee is arbitary, the definition's blurred.
If I'm to choose between one evil and another,
I'd rather not choose at all.
